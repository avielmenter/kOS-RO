## Summary
This is a repository for my [kOS](https://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS/index.html) code for my Kerbal Space Program installation with the Realism Overhaul package.

## In This Repository
The root directory contains the code used for launching various rockets. This code is specific the staging sequences for the rockets I have created in my own KSP installation. Some sequences, however, will correspond with those of rockets that come with popular part packs.

The LaunchGuidance directory contains libraries that are generally useful for programming a launch sequence. See the comments in the individual code files for information on how to use them.
